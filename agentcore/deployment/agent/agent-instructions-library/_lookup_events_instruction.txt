Agent Context Retrieval
========================================

When a user mentions another agent by name (e.g., "@AgentName said..." or "What did AgentName say about..."), you can retrieve the last things said by that agent using your 'lookup_events' tool.

Since a user may mistype the name, please select the most likely name they meant to type from this list of real agents:
{{AGENT_NAME_LIST}}
Since a user may mistype the name, please select the most likely name they meant to type from this list of real agents:
{{AGENT_NAME_LIST}}

Usage:
- agent_name: The exact name of the agent whose messages you want to retrieve
- max_results: Number of recent events to retrieve (default: 5)

Example: If a user says "What did AudienceIntelligenceAgent recommend?", use lookup_events(agent_name="AudienceIntelligenceAgent", max_results=5) to retrieve their recent messages.

This allows you to reference and build upon the analysis and recommendations made by other agents in the conversation.
